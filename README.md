Ammonia accounts for 1-3% of the worldâ€™s energy consumption, 5% of natural gas
consumption, and around 3% of greenhouse gas emissions. Because of the significances of these
factors, a more sustainable and environmentally friendly way of manufacturing ammonia is desired.
However, due to the energy-intensive nature of typical chemical processes (i.e. Haber-Bosch) used
in ammonia production, these processes are typically located along the Gulf Coast in the US due
to the high availability of natural gas. Moreover, the extreme operating conditions of a typical
ammonia plant inevitably make it a very large plant. Additionally, most of the synthesized
ammonia is used as agricultural fertilizer; therefore, it must be shipped to regions such as the Corn
Belt in the Midwest region. Ammonia is a toxic gas at ambient conditions thus requiring expensive
shipping and insurance costs. Therefore, designing a small-scale ammonia synthesis plant in
geographic proximity to the customers in the Midwest is ideal in reducing transportation costs,
providing an alternate supply chain for these customers, and meeting the large ammonia fertilizer
demand in the region.

We were asked by the engineering department for such a design that would serve as an
alternative supply chain to the current ammonia production process. By utilizing the Aspen Plus
v8.6 simulator and vigorously investigating external literature/resources, we designed a modular
ammonia synthesis plant that fitted the design criteria set forth by the engineering department. Our
design consists of an upstream nitrogen production process using pressure swing adsorption (PSA),
an upstream hydrogen production process using alkaline electrolysis, and a downstream reactive-
absorption ammonia synthesis loop that can produce 50 metric tons per day (mtpd) of anhydrous
ammonia at a purity of 99.6% by mass. Along with a full technical characterization of our proposed
design, we also conducted a preliminary economic analysis and an environmental/health/safety
analysis to accompany the technical design.

## What We Did

Due to the high shipping costs associated with ammonia transportation and the large demands of ammonia as a fertilizer in the Midwest region, we designed a modular ammonia synthesis process with a production capability of 50 metric tons per day (mtpd). This small-scale modular process will be located in geographic proximity to agricultural customers in the Midwest to meet the large ammonia fertilizer demands and provide an alternate supply chain to these customers. Our proposed process can be broken down into three parts: the upstream nitrogen production process, the upstream hydrogen production process, and the downstream ammonia synthesis loop. In the upstream processes, nitrogen gas is generated through pressure swing absorption (PSA) and hydrogen gas is generated through alkaline electrolysis. The two components are essential raw materials for producing ammonia. The downstream process is an absorbent enhanced ammonia synthesis process consists of a catalyst enhanced fix bed reactor, typical in Haber-Bosch ammonia synthesis processes, and an absorption system that recovers ammonia as opposed to a condenser and separator used in a typical Haber-Bosch process. The efficient ammonia recovery by the absorption system allows the ammonia synthesis reaction to be carried out at much lower pressures thereby reducing the size and costs associated with the process to make a small-scale process viable. Using the Aspen Plus v8.6 simulator, we designed our process and evaluated various factors associated with it.

Our final design utilized six ammonia synthesis modules run in parallel to meet the 50 mtpd production goal. By using the modular design strategy and incorporating process intensification strategies such as reactive-absorption, we were able to successfully to scale-down the Haber-Bosch process to the desired production goal. The absorption feature of our process enabled us to successfully reduce the operating pressure and equipment size/costs while the use of electrolysis for hydrogen production significantly reduced the carbon emission of our process. The utilization of cheap renewable electricity from wind energy in the Midwest region helped to decrease utility costs associated with energy-intensive processes such as electrolysis. However, our process is currently not economically viable and will not make any profit within its project lifetime of 20 years.

We recommend increasing the individual modular sizes and increase the production rate of each module. By doing so, we can further mitigate the effects of loss of economy of scale and increase our profit margins with increased production capabilities. The overall process will still be at a small-scale but because of the large demand in ammonia fertilizer in the Midwest region, we believe an increased production rate is justifiable. Additionally, better power purchase agreements could be negotiated to further reduce the cost of electricity from renewable wind energy and decrease utility/operating costs. An energy storage system can be built for the electrolysis system as well where energy will be stored to create a steady supply of electricity for the process. Since the electrolysis system is currently contributing to a large fraction of the capital and operating costs, other methods to produce hydrogen can be employed that are much cheaper; although, these methods may not result in reduced carbon emissions.
